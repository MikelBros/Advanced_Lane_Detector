# Advanced_Lane_Detector

The goal of this project was to detect the current lane the vehicle is driving on  by using its forward facing camera. This is a somewhat naive way as it is mainly using computer vision techniques (no relation to naive Bayesian!). Features we are going to detect and track are lane boundaries and surrounding vehicles
