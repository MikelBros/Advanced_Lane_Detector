# Advanced Lane Detector

The goal of this project was to detect the current lane the vehicle is driving on by using its forward facing camera and classic computer vision techniques in OpenCV. The result can still hardly be applied in the field but it is much better than the naive approach. However, it could possibly be used in order to complement semantic segmentation datasets by the current vehicle's lane.
